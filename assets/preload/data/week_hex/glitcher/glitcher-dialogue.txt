:bf:Huff.. puff... wow we spent a whole day on this.
:bf:Aren't you tired?
:hex:Nope! Not yet at least.
:hex:My battery is solar-based so i'm saving energy at nights!
:bf:Pff, lucky you then.
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT14
:gf:I'm tired though... I think we should go now.
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT15
:bf:I agree.

:BGTRACK:hectic
:bf:H-Huh? Hex?
:hex-virus:...Uh oh.
:hex-virus:I think we might have a problem...
:bf:What problem?
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT19
:hex-virus:I probably used too much processing power and let my guard down...
:hex-virus:Something might have passed by my defenses, which means...
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT20
:hex-virus:There might be a virus inside me.
:gf:Huh? Wait, isn't that like, dangerous to machines?
:hex-virus:VERY dangerous.... oh no.
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT21
:hex-virus:I think it wants to take control over the system.
:bf:Shoot... can't you do something to prevent that?
:hex-virus:I... don't think i can... but.
:hex-virus:Wait. Maybe you can.
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT22
:bf:Huh?
:hex-virus:Grab my mic and fight that thing off!
:hex-virus:If you order the system to input enough mic patterns it might crash.
:hex-virus:Then i'll enter sleep mode and run a safety scan which will end that thing.
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT23
:hex-virus:Please! You're my only hope right now!
:bf:...
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT24
:bf:...Alright Hex, i'll try. I'm not leaving you behind.
:bf:Are you ready?
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT25
:hex-virus:...
:BGCHANGE:cutscenes/CUT26
:hex-virus:...I'm always ready.
